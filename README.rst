Core engine for tierra_qa package

----

This `Pytest`_ plugin was generated with `Cookiecutter`_ along with `@hackebrot`_'s `Cookiecutter-pytest-plugin`_ template.


Features
--------

``pytest-pypom-navigation`` is not intended to be used as a standalone package.

It provides the core engine for the strong opinionated scaffolding solution called cookiecutter-qa.
If you want to create a QA project based on Selenium/Splinter you can install cookiecutter-qa and
generate a new ready to be used package with a working hello world.

Since the core engine of the QA scaffold has been decoupled it will be easier to keep updated
previously generated projects.
